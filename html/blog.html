           <h2 id="everything">A Little Bit of New York, Seattle, Portland, and Alaska</h2>
          <p>July 31, 2017<p>
          <p>This month has been a pretty crazy month! It started off by finishing a work trip to NYC, heading to Seattle for a couple days before flying off to Anchorage and then returning to NYC where I decided to spend some time and get to know the city.</p>
          
          <p>I absolutely adore the city of Seattle. It's by far my favorite west coast city (yes even in the winter). I have a lot of good memories from when I used to live there and living in Portland was fun, but didn't compare to Seattle. If I ever move back to the west coast I imagine I'll land in Seattle. This trip was a bit different than my normal Seattle trip. I decided to get myself a hostel room in Belltown and hangout with a hostel group for 4th of July. The group I ran into was a very young group of Irish guys (19 to 21 year olds). They were definitely a fun group, but I did feel like an old man compared to them and their energy. The best part of that experience was when the fireworks were going off over Lake Union they were trying to their best to yell "America! Fuck Yeah!" in redneck accents. Overall a very fun time and I did manage to get to hangout with my best friend and her boyfriend for a bit!</p>
          
          <p>Anchorage was beautiful. I will start by saying that I definitely needed a car to full experience the city. The city itself isn't that amazing and is frankly quite expensive even compared to places like New York and San Francisco. And it's also a place where you need to go with a group. I wanted to go hiking a lot, but I was constantly warned not to go by myself or without a gun. So I ended up just exploring the city and did manage to sneak over to a few beach/bay areas. I want to go to Alaska again in the future, but I'll probably go to Juneau.</p>
          
          <p>I'm now back in New York where I plan on being for awhile. I just finished up a 2 week stay at a terrible little hostel in Chelsea. It was cheap I'll give it that, but you really get what you pay for. I've never seen so many bugs in a room before and luckily there weren't any bed bugs (just nasty tiny cockroaches). I'm very thankful to get out of there and into my own place in the Upper East Side. I also think I won the jackpot with companies to work for. Amplify is one of the most easy going big companies I've ever seen. I have some high hopes for this place, but I also have to remember I am still just contracting with them and don't want to get super invested until I'm full time. Still one of the most noble and balanced companies I've seen though.</p>
          
          <h2 id="travel">Traveling</h2>
          <p>July 17, 2017</p>
            <p>Hey everyone! This is the first blog post of hopefully many. I just wanted to give a brief introduction about myself and what it is I do.</p>

              <p>In June I decided to start focusing on traveling a bit more seriously. The company I work for allows for some of it's employees to work remotely. While I'm not full time remote I have gone on several week long trips around the country and hopefully soon around the world!</p>

              <p>Last week I was up in Alaska staying at a fun little hostel, eating some great seafood and enjoying the beautiful sights of Anchorage and the nature around it. The few days before that I was in Seattle where I used to live just getting a few days of exploration in.</p>

              <p>My next big trip is Barcelona at the beginning of September. I recently moved over to NYC which kind of throws in a wrench in those plans, but I'm still hoping to make it work. It will be my first visit to Europe and first visit out of the country as an adult.</p>

              <p>I'd like to talk about the challenges of working/traveling. The first is expenses of course. Staying in hostels and going out to eat will burn through your budget very fast. A hostel at 30 to 35 a night is still around 1000 a month. Plus if you don't want to work at a hostel you normally have to work at a cafe which is another 3 to 5 dollars a day on coffee (assuming you only have 1).</p>

              <p>One of the greatest challenges I faced though was being too tempted by the surroundings to actually put a full day of work in. I found myself having to get out of the hostel and into a quiet cafe or bar to actually not be distracted too much. I know when I get to Barcelona this is going to be a massive challenge. When the weekends roll around though it's amazing. Being able to explore Anchorage was awesome and I definitely want to go back and check it out.</p>

              <p>The next biggest challenge of working remotely is finding a decent remote contract. This is what stops most travelers from traveling around the world while working. Unless you want to live in a cheap country and survive on barely anything then you definitely need to land something pretty decent. I got very lucky with my past few clients and am now setup in a good place to land almost anything I need.</p>

              <p>Overall I would say that working and traveling is definitely an amazing experience if you can manage your time and budget correctly. My past few trips have been such a learning experience of just letting go of a lot of possessions and embracing new cultures.</p>
