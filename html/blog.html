          <p>July 17, 2017<p>
            <p>Hey everyone! This is the first blog post of hopefully many. I just wanted to give a brief introduction about myself and what it is I do.</p>

              <p>In June I decided to start focusing on traveling a bit more seriously. The company I work for allows for some of it's employees to work remotely. While I'm not full time remote I have gone on several week long trips around the country and hopefully soon around the world!</p>

              <p>Last week I was up in Alaska staying at a fun little hostel, eating some great seafood and enjoying the beautiful sights of Anchorage and the nature around it. The few days before that I was in Seattle where I used to live just getting a few days of exploration in.</p>

              <p>My next big trip is Barcelona at the beginning of September. I recently moved over to NYC which kind of throws in a wrench in those plans, but I'm still hoping to make it work. It will be my first visit to Europe and first visit out of the country as an adult.</p>

              <p>I'd like to talk about the challenges of working/traveling. The first is expenses of course. Staying in hostels and going out to eat will burn through your budget very fast. A hostel at 30 to 35 a night is still around 1000 a month. Plus if you don't want to work at a hostel you normally have to work at a cafe which is another 3 to 5 dollars a day on coffee (assuming you only have 1).</p>

              <p>One of the greatest challenges I faced though was being too tempted by the surroundings to actually put a full day of work in. I found myself having to get out of the hostel and into a quiet cafe or bar to actually not be distracted too much. I know when I get to Barcelona this is going to be a massive challenge. When the weekends roll around though it's amazing. Being able to explore Anchorage was awesome and I definitely want to go back and check it out.</p>

              <p>The next biggest challenge of working remotely is finding a decent remote contract. This is what stops most travelers from traveling around the world while working. Unless you want to live in a cheap country and survive on barely anything then you definitely need to land something pretty decent. I got very lucky with my past few clients and am now setup in a good place to land almost anything I need.</p>

              <p>Overall I would say that working and traveling is definitely an amazing experience if you can manage your time and budget correctly. My past few trips have been such a learning experience of just letting go of a lot of possessions and embracing new cultures.</p>
